A lightweight, open-source AI assistant built for small language models (e.g., Qwen 3.5 9b). PawLia brings persistent memory, multi-user sessions, and extensible skills to local hardware — no cloud API required.

## Key Features

### 🔌 Multiple Interfaces
All interfaces can run simultaneously in server mode:
- **CLI** — interactive terminal session
- **Telegram** — bot with voice transcription, image support, threads, and model switching
- **Matrix** — Element-compatible bot with voice transcription, image support, threads, and model switching
- **Webhook** — HTTP endpoint for custom integrations (`POST /chat`, `GET /notifications`)

### 👥 Multi-User Sessions
Each user gets their own isolated session with per-user memory and conversation history. Sessions are persisted to disk as Markdown files and expire from RAM after inactivity.

### 🧵 Thread Support
Telegram threads (forum topics) and Matrix thread-replies each get their own isolated **context window** within the user's session. Everything else — memory, identity files, skills, workspace — stays shared.

- The first message in a thread is seeded with the last 5 exchanges from the main conversation so the model has immediate context.
- Thread history is logged separately (`memory/thread_<id>_<date>.md`) and does not pollute the main conversation log.
- Model overrides (see below) can be set per-thread independently of the main context.

### 🤖 Per-Context Model Switching
Users can switch the active LLM at runtime without restarting the bot.

**Telegram** — `/model` command:
```
/model                  # show the current model for this context
/model qwen3:4b         # switch model (main chat or current thread)
```

**Matrix** — `!model` message prefix:
```
!model                  # show the current model for this context
!model qwen3:4b         # switch model (room or current thread)
```

The switch is **context-local**: using `/model` inside a thread only affects that thread; the main chat (and other threads) keep their own model. Overrides are persisted to disk and survive restarts.

### ⏰ Scheduler
PawLia can act proactively — a background scheduler checks every 60 seconds for:
- **Due reminders** from the built-in reminder tool (with daily/weekly/monthly recurrence)
- **Upcoming calendar events** from the organizer skill (15 min before start)

Notifications are delivered directly through the active interface (CLI, Telegram, Matrix) or buffered for polling (Webhook).

### 🛠️ AgentSkills
PawLia supports the [AgentSkills](https://agentskills.io) specification. Skills are self-contained directories with a `SKILL.md` and optional scripts.

Each skill runs as a **sub-agent** with its own LLM session and access to tools (Bash, etc.). The dispatcher (ChatAgent) decides which skill to call based on the user's request.

**User skills:** Place custom skills in `skills/user/`. They are loaded exactly like built-in skills — same format, same `SKILL.md` frontmatter. The `user/` directory is gitignored so personal skills don't pollute the repo.

### ⚙️ Provider-Agnostic LLM
Any OpenAI-compatible API works as a backend — Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, or any local server.

Every agent type can use a **different model and provider**. The lookup follows a fallback chain so you only configure what you want to override:

| Agent type | Fallback chain |
|------------|----------------|
| `chat` | `agents.chat` → `defaults` |
| `skill_runner` | `agents.skill_runner` → `defaults` |
| `vision` | `agents.vision` → `agents.chat` → `defaults` |
| `skill.<name>` | `agents.skills.<name>` → `agents.skill_runner` → `defaults` |

Minimal example — one model for everything:
```yaml
agents:
  defaults:
    model: qwen3.5:latest
    provider: ollama
```

With a dedicated vision model and a fast/cheap model for search:
```yaml
agents:
  defaults:
    model: qwen3.5:latest
    provider: ollama

  vision:
    model: qwen2.5vl:latest

  skills:
    searxng:
      model: qwen3:4b
      provider: groq
```

LLMs with identical configuration are reused across agent types — no redundant connections.

## Quick Start

1. Copy `config.sample.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill in your provider credentials.
2. Run in CLI mode:
   ```bash
   python -m pawlia
   ```
3. Run in server mode (Telegram, Matrix, Webhook):
   ```bash
   python -m pawlia --mode server
   ```
4. With Docker:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Configuration

See `config.sample.yaml` for all available options. Both `.yaml` and `.json` are supported.

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `providers` | LLM backend(s) and API keys |
| `agents.defaults` | Default model, provider, temperature |
| `agents.chat` | Override for the chat agent |
| `agents.skill_runner` | Default LLM for all skill sub-agents |
| `agents.vision` | LLM used when the user sends an image |
| `agents.skills.<name>` | Per-skill LLM override |
| `interfaces` | Enable Telegram / Matrix / Webhook |
| `skill-config` | Per-skill configuration (URLs, API keys, …) |
